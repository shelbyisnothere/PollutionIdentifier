# PollutionIdentifier #
Basic python program

### Description ###
This is a small program to identify pollutants in your area using either your city name or your zip-code. This program was intended to demonstrate basic python skills and basic usage of API's to access and process data.

## Compiling and Running ##

### API Keys ###
To prevent malicious use, any api keys used in this program are encrypted in the api_keys.py.gpg file. If you wish to run this program on a local machine, you may choose from the options below:

1. _Obtain your own api key._ You may visit the API websites listed below to obtain your own key. There are instructions below on how to add the key into the program. API calls used within this project are very minimal and should not exceed the free accesses provided by any of the API websites listed.

2. _Request access._ Files are encrypted via [StackExchange's BlackBox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox "BlackBox") and users may be granted access if they have blackbox configured on their own system. As of right now I am unsure how users will be able to contact me for permission requests, so this feature is more or less TBA.
